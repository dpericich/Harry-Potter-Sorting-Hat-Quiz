Ravenclaw corresponds to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws include Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockheart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander.`,
    Slytherin: `Slytherin House values ambition, leadership, self-preservation, cunning and resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin.

Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and Dark Wizards, including Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Black. But that does not mean that other Houses haven’t produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.`,
